  <p>The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) as of 2018 had a new website redesign to allow citizens a secure, quick, and easy way to view all transportation-related information. Unfortunately, despite an improved visual UI the site failed initial accessibility audits.

  <p>Originally brought on for front-end development, I noticed the accessibility issues when my battery-operated mouse died. This <a href="https://www.access-can.ca/news/the-state-of-disability#:~:text=Situational%20disabilities%20are%20a%20little,a%20permanent%20or%20temporary%20disability." target="_blank">situational disability</a> required I use my keyboard to navigate the website. It is important to recognize that accessibility is for everyone, from someone who is blind, has limb differentiation, to someone having a temporary or situational disability. As a government agency, the website is required to be W.C.A.G. 2.0/Section 508 accessible.</p>

     <!-- end heading -->
  <p>Section 508 as part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a law that requires government agencies to provide access to its Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to people with disabilities. The Revised 508 Standards incorporate by reference and apply the WCAG 2.0 Level AA Success Criteria to both web and non-web electronic content.</p>
