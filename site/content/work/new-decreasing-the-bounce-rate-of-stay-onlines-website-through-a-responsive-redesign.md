  Stay Online is a manufacturer and distributor of a wide selection of power cords and cables for the data center, power infrastructure and industrial markets. Stay Online's e-commerce website, launched in 1997, had not changed to be compliant with best practices introduced with HTML5.  


  **The Problem:** <span aria-hidden="true">🤔</span> <br/>Many users did not make or complete purchases. These users included a very high percentage of users from mobile devices.


  **The Plan:** <span aria-hidden="true">💡</span><br/>Redesign the existing website, focusing on responsive design and maintainable code. There was a potential to capture more users by making the web experience accessible. Responsive design was not an easy sell to management. Data-driven design through analytics would be used to get the pitch approved.


  **The starting rate:** <span aria-label="thumb down emoji">👎</span> about 85% of mobile users leave <br/> **The goal:** <span aria-label="okay hand emoji">👌</span> fewer than 50% of mobile users leave
