preview_intro: I started with one main goal, bring change in how Insight markets accessibility. Insightâ€™s Digital Innovation team helps companies implement digital solutions from discovery to delivery. During 2019 select individuals from the team came together to improve Insightâ€™s stake in accessibility. My role in this go-to-market plan involved ideation, creation of a delivery deck, documentation for bid strategy, and triage.
preview_problem: Accessibility as an integrated and offered solution was lacking. Through thoughtful internal planning and education a go-to-market strategy for Insight would be launched as a way for Insight to start taking on accessibility-specific projects. This would start with team education and would end with a client bid.
