## What's happened since last year?
Following up on my goals from 2022 for this year I'm at 2.5 out of 3. I was able to achieve the [CPWA certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/2aeb357c-4af8-463f-9824-4d3fd35998ea/linked_in_profile) and took the initiative to jump teams to become a lead mentor for a growing/under-performing team. This team has worked so hard in 2023 and the company is taking notice of the improvement—better quality and better efficiency. ✨ Still working on more fun ways to excercise and build muscle strength. I'm still wobbly on my rollerblades.

2023 started strong in the work and fun category with a company kick off (CKO) retreat in Chicago, Illinois. Level Access paid for all of us to go and stay in the windy city for a week and it was awesome! So many great speakes and so many city exploring to be had. I joined a new team and the CKO was my first time meeting the new team. During 2023 Level Access also went through a merger with Essential Accessibility. The merging of teams went on throughout 2023, but I have made many friends and met many amazing peers.

During this year I also lead a documentation team, was promoted to an accessibility consultant, had more opportunities to write acr/vpats and scope very large multi-unit audits as project owner. I was able to more fully attend GAAD events by contribuiting non-profit transcription/captioning, mentor students, and attend a virtual conference.

## Achievements, celebrations, & team feedback
After months of study I am so happy that 2023 was the year I achieved my CPWA (certified professional of web accessibility) certification, the highest level offered by IAAP. I have worked hard in all aspects of my work to become a recognized leader. Moving forward into 2024 this long-term goal is seeing fruition.

**Other things of note:**
- Took a needed vacation to Asheville, NC and had a spa-day ♡
- Met my Level Access co-workers in person for the first time
- Visited (and solved the mystery of) Omega Mart in Chicago, Illinois
