## What's happened since last year?
2022 was a huge year of change, learning, and growth. I started a new job on January 31, 2022, in my dream field of accessibility. I have been working towards this since 2018 so I am beyond proud of myself. Since last January I've been able to interact with over 115 different companies in order to help make their products accessible. I've learned 8 new skills and have implemented them this year with confidence including mobile accessibility testing, PDF testing and remediation, use case scripting, VPAT/ACR creation, design reviews and tech consults, and highly increased my expertise in ARIA. I've had an awesome mentor and become one myself. ♥

## Achievements, celebrations, & team feedback
Having previously worked as part of an agency I am used to fast-paced work and juggling multiple projects, but the amount of clients to juggle as part of Level Access in my fist year was immense. That said I put in a grat effort to stay on top of not just my own subtasks, but that of teammates I shared core tasks with. I also took extra initiative to keep clients engaged with statuses and help ensure work did not get cancelled due to lack of response. This resulted in me delivering 0 late projects over the course of 115 client interactions.

The axe throwing contest occured in February for my birthday and as my first experience with this type of sport I was very estatic to win. I received a pretty sweet trophy a few weeks later of an axe wedged into a block of wood. 

**Other things of note:**
- Started a co-worker chess group 
- Took more initiative to network on LinkedIn
- Participated in my first GAAD (global accessibility awareness day)
