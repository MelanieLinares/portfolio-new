## Responsive dashboard widgets
Brought on late into the project, the previous design team had already worked with the 
client to construct an elegant solution in the form of dashboard widgets. My role was 
to clean up the final design to ensure widgets were responsive and accurate to existing 
requirements, as well as last minute changes.

### Specific tasks:
- diagnose, debug and remedy defects
- ensure reusability of UI components
- integrate with weather api
- utilize SharePoint Workbench in visualizing and implementing SPFx widget components
- create 404 page

## The takeaway:  
While a short project, this was my first introduction to React and SharePoint Workbench. 
I have used and developed in SharePoint before, but the workbench made everything so much easier. Consider me a fan!
The LabCorp team was a pleasure to work with when proposing small design changes and in coming to a compromise on 
specific solutions. This experience jumpstarted my interest and drive to learn more about React so thank you team!  üëè
