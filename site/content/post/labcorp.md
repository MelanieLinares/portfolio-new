## Responsive dashboard widgets

client to construct an elegant solution in the form of dashboard widgets. My role was 
to clean up the final design to ensure widgets were responsive and accurate to existing 
requirements.

### Specific tasks:
- diagnose, debug, and remedy defects
- ensure reusability of UI components
- integrate with third-party apis
- utilize SharePoint Workbench in visualizing and implementing SPFx widget components

## The takeaway:  
While a short project, this was my first introduction to React and SharePoint Workbench. 
I have used and developed in SharePoint before, but Workbench made visualizing code changes so much easier. Consider me a fan!
The LabCorp team was a pleasure to work with when proposing small design changes and in coming to a compromise on 
specific solutions. This experience jumpstarted my interest and drive to learn more about React. Thank you team!  üëè
