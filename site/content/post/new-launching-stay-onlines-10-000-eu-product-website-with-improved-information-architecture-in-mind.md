  ### Overview:


  Stay Online is a manufacturer and distributor of a wide selection of power cords and cables for the data center, power infrastructure and industrial markets.


  **Problem:** <br/> Sales team members expressed difficulties handling customer satisfaction for international orders through the current website.


  **The Solution:** <br/>  Create a EU-specific site that prioritizes content and global UX patterns in order to increase sales and meets international standards.


  In 2015 Stay Online made the transition from a U.S. business to an international one. The company opened a shipping and manufacturing location in the Czech Republic. U.S. sales associates had expressed difficulties handling customer satisfaction for international orders. The new warehouse would hopefully solve many of the issues concerning shipping costs and turnaround time. Stay Online wanted a dedicated website to funnel in EU-specific orders before planning a merged site in the future. This site would need to reduce the strain on Sales team members and increase international orders.

            ## International and global UX was at the heart of
            product strategy


            ### Team Exploration and Planning


            * I co-lead a discovery session to explore project requirements, limitations, globalization needs, and eCommerce workflow

            * Internal goals outlined from a maintenance and code-based standpoint.

            * I interviewed international sales interns, Outside Sales team members, and the Marketing team for their specific needs

            * Marketing ran specific user surveys

            * Feedback prioritized into sprints

            * I conducted localization research and competitive analysis

            * I worked with Marketing to determine that the website would need multi-language support, translated documentation, and branding tweaks

            * Coding requirements identified to allow easier auto-translation of content


            Time was a limitation. This forced us to focus on a minimal viable experience for the initial sprint. A large amount of product APIs were required with little to no rewrite as the U.S. site also used the same data. Existing sub-sites and marketing materials would be carried over incrementally as translations completed.

            ### Wireframes and early iterations


            The process of wireframes and interactive prototypes for which the team would be conducted A/B testing a few things worked and didn’t in the ideation process.


            * Initially internal stakeholders did not want category changes, but minifying categories proved helpful for user experience and profitable when considering click-through rate once the site moved into development. 

            * The low-resolution photography-based design approach moved to high-resolution display images and iconography/illustration instead of cut out products. 

            * The process was time-consuming, but elevated the brand image. The responsive menu, which went through many iterations and tests, proved one of the design's strengths.


            Early ideas that did not work and did not make it into final designs include a horizontal top menu for products, no sidebar layout, and homepage content consensus.

            ### Major navigation changes


            * Existing U.S. site navigation sidebar had grown in complexity over time

            * A/B testing on a mega menu style horizontal navigation vs the existing vertical style conducted

            * Testers expressed confusion over product category location (mega menu was not toggled on load so the only available navigation link was “products”)

            * After several iterations using tester feedback, the decision was made to revert to the sidebar approach but keep the new category labels


            Through a few iterations, categories for products arranged on the sidebar led to less time scrolling on the homepage and a higher click through rate. Previously, heat maps showed that the long category list (originally requiring scrolling) experienced a below-the-fold drop-off. After the categories were reduced the heat map data proved more evenly distributed.

            ### Search functionality and results page changes


            * U.S. website did not have a dedicated search page, relying on a Google search plugin that would populate results within a frame

            * Search page utilizing new site API was added

            * The team troubleshooted search term accuracy, category and individual product keyword tagging, as well as accounted for misspellings

            * The team A/B tested category pages being included within the result

            ### Product and category page changes


            * Previously to get to a product detail page a user may need to click through up to 4 or 5 categories

            * The new design would reduce the clicks ideally to 2 (parent and then sub category)

            * The previous U.S. design utilized a list-view. The only advantage to the detail view was wishlisting an item or checking technical documents

            * The new design would add functionality for condensing products differentiated previously only by length and color, as well as adding info related to shipping, VAT, and safety certifications
