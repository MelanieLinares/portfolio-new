introheading: Creating a plan to help online consumers find products quickly and globally
introbody: >-
  Stay Online is a manufacturer and distributor of a wide selection of power cords and cables for the data center, power infrastructure and industrial markets. In 2015 Stay Online made the transition from a U.S. business to an international one. The company opened a shipping and manufacturing location in the Czech Republic. U.S. sales associates had expressed difficulties handling customer satisfaction for international orders. 


  **The Problem:** <span aria-hidden="true">🤔</span><br/>Sales team members expressed difficulties handling customer satisfaction for international orders through the current website. International customers expressed frustration with U.S.-centric site content and often left their shopping carts at the shipping stage of checkout.


  **The Plan:** <span aria-hidden="true">💡</span><br/>Create a EU-specific site that prioritizes content and global UX patterns in order to increase sales and meets international standards.

            ### What is global UX?

            Global UX is a catch-all term that includes multi-language and multi-culture within the UX process. This includes localization, internationalization, and ISO 9241 standard (including country-specific standards).

            - **Localization** - a process through which a website or product is adapted to a specific market. Considerations include: actual content of the app, language, and currency.
            
            - **Internationalization** - process of preparing products, services, and internal operations for expansion into global markets. Considerations include: fonts, icons, colors, layout, and specific code implemetations.

            - [ISO 9241](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9241:-110:ed-2:v1:en), Ergonomics of Human-System Interaction, among other international standards and laws were considered, including [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/).

            ### Team Exploration & Planning


            * I co-lead a discovery session to explore project requirements, limitations, globalization needs, and eCommerce workflow

            * Internal goals outlined from a maintenance and code-based standpoint.

            * I interviewed international sales interns, Outside Sales team members, and the Marketing team for their specific needs

            * Marketing ran specific user surveys

            * Feedback prioritized into sprints

            * I conducted localization research and competitive analysis

            * I worked with Marketing to determine that the website would need multi-language support, translated documentation, and branding tweaks

            * Coding requirements identified to allow easier auto-translation of content


            Time was a limitation. This forced us to focus on a minimal viable experience for the initial sprint. A large amount of product APIs were required with little to no rewrite as the U.S. site also used the same data. Existing sub-sites and marketing materials would be carried over incrementally as translations completed.

  #         ### Wireframes & early iterations

  #         The process of wireframes and interactive prototypes for which the team would be conducted A/B testing a few things worked and didn’t in the ideation process.


  #         * Initially internal stakeholders did not want category changes, but minifying categories proved helpful for user experience and profitable when considering click-through rate once the site moved into development. 

  #         * The low-resolution photography-based design approach moved to high-resolution display images and iconography/illustration instead of cut out products. 

  #         * The process was time-consuming, but elevated the brand image. The responsive menu, which went through many iterations and tests, proved one of the design's strengths.


  #         Early ideas that did not work and did not make it into final designs include a horizontal top menu for products, no sidebar layout, and homepage content consensus.

            ### Major navigation changes


            * Existing U.S. site navigation sidebar had grown in complexity over time

            * A/B testing on a mega menu style horizontal navigation vs the existing vertical style conducted

            * Testers expressed confusion over product category location (mega menu was not toggled on load so the only available navigation link was “products”)

            * After several iterations using tester feedback, the decision was made to revert to the sidebar approach but keep the new category labels


            Through a few iterations, categories for products arranged on the sidebar led to less time scrolling on the homepage and a higher click through rate. Previously, heat maps showed that the long category list (originally requiring scrolling) experienced a below-the-fold drop-off. After the categories were reduced the heat map data proved more evenly distributed.

            ### Search functionality & results page changes


            * U.S. website did not have a dedicated search page, relying on a Google search plugin that would populate results within a frame

            * Search page utilizing new site API was added

            * The team troubleshooted search term accuracy, category and individual product keyword tagging, as well as accounted for misspellings

            * The team A/B tested category pages being included within the result

            ### Product & category page changes


            * Previously to get to a product detail page a user may need to click through up to 4 or 5 categories

            * The new design would reduce the clicks ideally to 2 (parent and then sub category)

            * The previous U.S. design utilized a list-view. The only advantage to the detail view was wishlisting an item or checking technical documents

            * The new design would add functionality for condensing products differentiated previously only by length and color, as well as adding info related to shipping, VAT, and safety certifications

          ## The takeaway
          
          - 👍 The website saw improved search efficiency over the A/B testing and launch period through the use of categories

          - 👍 Optimized keywords increased efficiency in finding products via search

          - 👌 Category changes were implemented without negatively affecting the U.S. database (the plan was to merge category changes over to the U.S site)

          - Internationalization is not just translation and takes time and effort from many cross-functional teams
          
          - The site was released on a very short timeline. I learned a lot from leading this project, both about global standards but also how to properly manage multiple teams.
