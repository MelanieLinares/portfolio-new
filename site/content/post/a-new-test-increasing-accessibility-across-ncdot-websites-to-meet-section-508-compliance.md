introbody: >-
  The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) as of 2018 had a new
  website redesign to allow citizens a secure, quick, and easy way to view all
  transportation-related information. Unfortunately, despite an improved visual
  UI the site failed initial accessibility audits.


  **The starting score:**  67 (based on Google Lighthouse)

  **The goal:** score greater than 80
