  The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) as of 2018 had a new
  website redesign to allow citizens a secure, quick, and easy way to view all
  transportation-related information. Unfortunately, despite an improved visual
  UI the site failed initial accessibility audits.


  **The starting score:**  67 (based on Google Lighthouse)


  **The goal:** score greater than 80

      Originally brought on for front-end development, I noticed the
      accessibility issues when my battery-operated mouse died. This situational
      disability required I use my keyboard to navigate the website. It is
      important to recognize that accessibility is for everyone, from someone
      who is blind, has limb differentiation, to someone having a temporary or
      situational disability. As a government agency, the website is required to
      be W.C.A.G. 2.0/Section 508 accessible.
