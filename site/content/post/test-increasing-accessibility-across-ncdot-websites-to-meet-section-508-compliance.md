introheading: Creating a plan for usability and accessibility
introbody: >-
  The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) as of 2018 had a new
  website redesign to allow citizens a secure, quick, and easy way to view all
  transportation-related information. Unfortunately, despite an improved visual
  UI the site failed initial accessibility audits.


  **The starting score:**  67 (based on Google Lighthouse)


  **The goal:** score greater than 80

      Originally brought on for front-end development, I noticed the
      accessibility issues when my battery-operated mouse died. This situational
      disability required I use my keyboard to navigate the website. It is
      important to recognize that accessibility is for everyone, from someone
      who is blind, has limb differentiation, to someone having a temporary or
      situational disability. As a government agency, the website is required to
      be W.C.A.G. 2.0/Section 508 accessible.




      ### What is W.C.A.G?


      The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are part of a series of web accessibility guidelines considered to be the benchmark for compliance.\



      ### What is Section 508?


      Section 508 as part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a law that requires government agencies to provide access to its Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to people with disabilities. The Revised 508 Standards incorporate by reference and apply the WCAG 2.0 Level AA Success Criteria to both web and non-web electronic content.

    caption: Horizontal alerts within the header and pop alerts provided imporant
      information to users visually and needed ARIA live region roles to share
      this information with users not accessing the site visually.

      Wait, what?!!! You can enter a image block and code block?? You can't change the order, but it enters in the order placed, and you can have multiple iterations.


      ![alt text](img/Group 507@2x.png "title")


      ![alt2](img/Image 60.png "title2")


      ```

      This is a code block :)
