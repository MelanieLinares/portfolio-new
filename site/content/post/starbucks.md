## The takeaway:  

<div style="display: flex" class="image-block">
<div>
<p>Y'all, did you know that React is great for making dynamic components? ðŸ˜‰ I learned about component hierarchy through this project and it was my first deep dive into learning TypeScript. Starbucks 
has a very knowledgeable team that was a great asset during design and development. I always love working directly with UX and 
back-end folks and this project experience had both. The Starbucks team knew what they needed from this platform 
and I'm glad our team was able to deliver. â˜•âœ¨</p>
