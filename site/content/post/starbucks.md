## Changing a simple form into a powerful workflow
Managing assets can be a pain if the application does not optimize how actions such as add, remove, save, etc. are implemented.
I worked with the UX team to implement and improve wireframes, create case studies and identify edge cases. 
My role was to take the approved interactive prototype and data specs to build out the needed pages and components using React and TypeScript.

### Specific tasks
- create new UI components
- ensure reusability of existing and new components
- integrate with REST apis
- identify and debug code, as well as UI errors
- improve UI error messages and notifications

## The takeaway:  
Y'all, did you know that React is great for making dynamic components? ðŸ˜‰ I learned about component hierarchy through this project and it was my first deep dive into learning TypeScript. Starbucks 
has a very knowledgeable team that was a great asset during design and development. I always love working directly with UX and 
back-end folks and this project experience had both. The Starbucks team knew what they needed from this platform 
and I'm glad our team was able to deliver. â˜•âœ¨
