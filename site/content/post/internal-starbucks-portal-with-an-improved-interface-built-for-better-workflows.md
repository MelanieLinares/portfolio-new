          At this point in 2021, virtual working had really solidified itself as
          normal within Insight’s design and development teams. Starbucks was
          still adjusting to this process during onboarding. To make sure
          everyone was comfortable with the project a kick-off meeting was held
          to go over the Starbucks team’s development environment, as well as
          establish expectations.

        Content002: When multiple teams work together several perspectives and expertise
          can be utilized. After UX internally met with shareholders to create
          the first version of the UI I met with them and we worked together to
          harmonize the feedback along with information I gathered from the data
          team.
