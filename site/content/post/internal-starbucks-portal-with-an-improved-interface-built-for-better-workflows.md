          At this point in 2021, virtual working had really solidified itself as
          normal within Insight’s design and development teams. Starbucks was
          still adjusting to this process during onboarding. To make sure
          everyone was comfortable with the project a kick-off meeting was held
          to go over the Starbucks team’s development environment, as well as
          establish expectations.
