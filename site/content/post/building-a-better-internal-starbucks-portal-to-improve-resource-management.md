introheading: Updating a dashboard UI for a better management workflow
introbody: >-
  Managing data can be a pain if common actions within an application result in errors or the actions are not easily found within the UI. My role involved developing components with React and TypeScript.




  **The Problem:** <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ¤”</span><br/>This internal Starbucks portal experienced sync issues and error management issues.


  **The Plan:** <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ’¡</span><br/>The Starbucks team needed to easily see information on assets being managed. A main dashboard with access to all data and the ability to display cross-data information was proposed.

            ## Meeting with the team to workshop improvements


            To make sure everyone was comfortable with the project, a kick-off meeting was held. The meeting agenda involved going over the development environment and establishing expectations.


            > The first step in exceeding customer expectations is to know those expectations


            ### Project expectations


            * I would need to deliver on a fast turn-around schedule

            * Weekly stand-up meetings would be required along with code reviews

            * React and Typescript were utilized in developing widgets, including the creation and application of variables for branding color and typography 

            * I would be working with the product and engineering teams on enterprise-facing features

          ## Working with the UX team to refine UI


          The UX team first met with shareholders to create the initial version of the UI. I met with the UX team after this session and we worked together to harmonize the feedback, along with information I gathered from the API team. There were several problems to be solved, not merely a UI to create.


          ### How might we improve how the data, including errors, are managed?

          Existing APIs for each data set were causing issues. Currently there was no user feedback for issues prior to submission and an unclear error after submission. The big question was how should errors be handled within the UI and within the API? Could and should error states be avoided?

              ### Refining the UI to account for errors


              * I collaborated with product and design teams to define features and identify opportunities for improvement

              * The prototype was improved to account for edge cases in user flow

              * Error messages and notifications were improved by providing thoughtful feedback

              * Error messages and portal data visualizations needed to be accessible

              <div class="pill-featured-text">
              <div class="left-text-only">Accessibility is not just for public-facing applications. It was important for me to emphasize this to the team.</div>

            ## Building the components according to atomic design


            * I developed UI components based on existing widgets and from scratch utilizing React, Typescript, and some Java

            * Collaboration was important to the process. I worked with the backend and frontend teams to ensure optimized API calls between parent and child components

            * Some components included: typography, color palettes, data cards, tables, modals, and forms

            * Testing API and working with API developers

          ## The takeaway
          
          > Donâ€™t over-complicate components. Reusability is key!

          - UI updates and new widgets were created and delivered

          - Components were built for usability and by utilizing test-driven development practices

          - Accessibility and performance improvements were implemented alongside the requested features. It was important to emphasize the necessity for accessible error messages and form elements to the team.
 
        
          Starbucks has a very knowledgeable team and I loved working directly with the UX and back-end folks. I'm glad the Insight team was able to deliver a robust user interface for Starbucks. <span aria-hidden="true">â˜•âœ¨</span>
