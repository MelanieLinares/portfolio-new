  ## Creating a plan to increase usability and accessibility
  The NCDOTâ€™s new website (as of 2018) allows citizens a secure, quick, and easy way to view all transportation-related information. Unfortunately, despite looking great the site failed initial accessibility audits. This is not good for a government website.
  <br>
  **The starting score:** This is wrapped in a section?? 67 (based on Google Lighthouse)
  <br>
  **The goal:** accessibility within a 3rd-party (SharePoint 2016) can be tricky, but 
  we needed to reach > 90

## Why the concern over accessibility?
  Originally brought on for front-end development, I noticed the accessibility issues when my battery-operated mouse died. This "situational disability" required I use my keyboard to navigate the website. It may seem small, but it is important to recognize that accessibility is for everyone, from someone who is blind, has limb differentiation, to someone having a temporary or situational disability. As a government agency, the website is required to be accessible.  
  ### <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸš©</span> The main issue for citizens
  - Those with vision disabilities are unable to understand important safety and legal announcements
  - Those with physical disabilities have a hard (or impossible) time making convenient online transactions
  - Those with situational or temporary disabilities (including slower internet speeds) have difficulties accessing 
  ### <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸš©</span> The main issue for the NCDOT: 
  - As a federal agency, the websites for the NCDOT and NCDMV must meet Section 508 regulations and be ADA compliant. Failure to meet guidelines can lead to lawsuits.     
  - A federal agency can lose citizen and customer trust

</div>

  > Accessibility is about access, pure and simple. If a government application cannot be used by citizens then never mind the legal repercussions, the design improvements are wasted.

  ## Conducting the accessibility audit

  ### Establishing a baseline
  - testing level was established according to government regulations and client needs
  - the first step was in identifying page templates and associated JavaScript components 
  - sorted most viewed pages by template and then tested with Lighthouse for baseline needed improvements 
  - guidelines reviewed and a goal checklist created prior to testing

  <div>

  ### Manual testing
  - NVDA screen readerused to identify issues with the information hierarchy and HTML syntax
  - keyboard testing conducted to find outliers in accessing content
  - web extensions (such as Colorblinding, NoCoffee Vision Simulator, and Disability Simulator) used for hard to identify issues
  - TalkBack and VoiceOver used to test mobile devices

  ### Automatic testing
  - Axe DevTools
  - W.A.V.E. (web accessibility evaluation tool)
  - Chrome DevTools
  - Accessibility Insights for the Web
  - cross-browser testing emphasized

  ## Audit findings and breakdown
  ### Focus on components
  Components associated with key functionality prioritized. If a user cannot interact correctly with a design then it is ineffective, regardless of aesthetics.
  - Date pickers could not be accessed via keyboard
  - Contact form in the footer of every page
  - Incorrect use of headings based on the template

  ### Sorting pages on most viewed pages to prioritize testing 
  - Homepage
  - Contact
  - About
  - Form-based application pages
  - Commonly used information such as locations and how-to info
  ### Screen readers and understanding the rotor 
  Proper use of headings, sections, and links help ensure a screen reader user can access content quickly and directly.
  ### Keyboard testing and why you should not use CSS to disguise focus:  
  It is important to ensure a keyboard can navigate a page. Content should have proper focus and not disappear off-screen. You may not like the look of a focus ring around a link but it serves a functional purpose.

  ## Major changes and impact

  ### Keyboard changes  
  - Skip to main link existed but was not functional, now a user can skip the lengthy navigation if they choose
  - Headings reorganized and given proper hierarchy according to semantics vs aesthetics
  - Focus rings on vital links added back, as well as hover underlines
  - Elements arranged out of logical order via CSS caused issues when tabbing through content. Content and CSS adjusted so layout matched original, but improved for screen readers

  ### Alerts & pop-ups
  - Originally not accessible via tabbing and did not have an easy way to close
  - Alerts of important information were not announced to screen readers. Aria used responsibly to resolve the issue.

  ### Repeatable components
  - Some components found to be inaccessible.  Adjusted code as able. Others (often plugins) replaced with native HTML5

  ### Navigation
  - Navigation built with separate mobile and desktop code toggled according to media queries. The issue is both still accessed via a screen reader regardless of screen size.
  - Originally not all built using lists. The navigation was not properly read by a screen reader. Some info was skipped or not announced as link or navigation items. The content needed roles adjusted.

  ## The takeaway: 
  The original goal was to reach >90 via Lighthouse and this was successful. Of course a Lighthouse score does not ensure an accessible application, but was used as a benchmark. The remediation tasks were re-tested manually and through an automatic tool such as Axe DevTools. Previously the website, when read aloud via a screen reader, would stop after navigation or would after the first heading. The team was given a demo of the before and after. Training concluded the remediation to proactively reduce accessibility issues in the future.
