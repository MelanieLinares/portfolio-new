introheading: Creating a plan to help online consumers find products quickly and globally
introbody: |-
  In 2015 Stay Online made the transition from a US business to an international one. The company opened a shipping and manufacturing location in the Czech Republic. Stay Online wanted a dedicated website to funnel in EU-specific orders before planning a merged site in the future.

  **The goal:** Prioritize content along with global UX patterns to create a site able to keep up with new shipping needs.

overviewbody: |-
  ### The baseline:
  üí° Sales associates noticed an increase in international customers with specific power cord needs that Stay Online could not provide given the high shipping costs when exporting.

  ### The goal:
  üèÅ increase the number of sales to the EU and help these users find products they can use quickly
  
  - Design needs to maintain IE9+ browser compatibility
  - Data-heavy pages need to balance showing necessary data and providing an ideal mobile experience
  - Branding needs to fit with existing Stay Online principles but also incorporate global standards and practices
  - Complete A/B testing for layout to determine navigation approach
  - Bring iconography to the branding forefront
  - Work with Marketing and Sales managers to identify business needs for the new homepage
overviewblurb: |-  
  It may not seem bad to have a lot of products, but if not organized efficiently within an e-commerce website then those same products start becoming a huge problem. We needed to create an easy purchasing experience.
purplesectionheading: Team exploration and planning for a MVP release
purplesection1: |-
  Stay Online brought me onto the EU launch team due to my familiarity with the U.S. website and my experience with responsive development. I co-led a discovery session to explore eCommerce requirements, limitations, and internationalization needs with outside sales representatives.

  ### Why internationalization?
  Stay Online needed an EU location for shipping but you might ask, why did they need a new website?
  - easy localization for target audience culture, region, language
  - coding process that allows for translation

  ### Information Gathering
  - considerations such as GDPR, color best-practices, localized terms
  - Marketing and Sales teams were interviewed for their specific needs - feedback was then prioritized into sprints      
  - Existing sub-sites and marketing materials would be carried over incrementally as translations were completed
  - Grouped notes and outlined internal goals from a maintenance and code-based standpoint

purplesection2: |-
  ### Project Requirements
  - A large amount of product APIs were required with little to no rewrite as the U.S. site also used the same data     
  - Focus on minimal viable product (MVP) for the first release 
  - Time would be a large design and development hindrance
  - Waterfall release method

  ## Internationalization and globalization was at the heart of the go-to market strategy 
  - international sales interns, Outside Sales team members, and the Marketing team were interviewed      
  - Marketing ran specific user surveys
  - The website would need multi-language support, translated documentation, and branding tweaks
  - Focus on bold colors, image-focused design, EU-specific regulation requirements
  - Unicode considerations
  - Coding requirements to allow easier auto translation of content

  ## A new market means new users and expectations

  ### What do users of this new website need?  
  - Two categories of user were identified: internal team member and external purchasing customer      
  - Stay Online team members would submit orders on behalf of the company and for phone orders
  - External customers included one time buy customers and return annual buyers who bought in bulk
  - Greater expectation for product customization and proof that products meet EU regulations
  - User flows, based on current requirements and frustrations, were created. These identified a common difficulty of finding products quickly

  ### Major navigation changes 
  - Existing U.S. approach for site navigation was with a sidebar menu that grew in height over time      
  - Initial A/B testing on a mega menu style horizontal navigation vs the existing vertical style
  - Testers expressed confusion over navigation location (mega menu was not toggled on load so the only available navigation link was ‚Äúproducts‚Äù)
  - After several prototype versions, using tester feedback, a decision was made to revert to the sidebar approach but keep the new category labels

  ## The takeaway: 
  - üëç The website saw improved search efficiency over the A/B testing and launch period through the use of categories
  - üëç Optimized keywords increased efficiency in finding products via search
  - üëå Category changes were implemented without negatively affecting the U.S. database (the plan was to merge category changes over to the U.S site)
  - Internationalization is not just translation and takes time and effort from many cross-functional teams  
  - The site was released on a very short timeline. I learned a lot from leading this project, both about global standards but also how to properly manage multiple teams.
