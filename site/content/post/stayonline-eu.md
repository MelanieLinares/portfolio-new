## Creating a plan to help users find a product quickly
In 2015 Stay Online made the transition from a US business to an international one. The 
company opened a shipping and manufacturing location in the Czech Republic. This 
new manufacturing location would need to take orders for the existing product line as well as new products. The new site would apply internationalization and global UX so new EU customers could handle orders.

### The baseline:
💡 Sales associates noticed an increase in international customers with specific power cord needs that Stay Online could not provide. Sales associates noticed several new and previous re-occurring customers were discontinuing their accounts due to shipping costs when shipping to the EU.

### The goal:
🏁 users (internal and external) find products more efficiently

## Project overview and task breakdown 

- BBLLLAAAHHHH Design needs to maintain IE6+ (and later IE8+) browser compatibility
- Data-heavy pages need to balance showing necessary data and providing an ideal mobile experience
- Use-cases for redesign include customers, but also warehouse workers and sales employees at tradeshows
- Branding needs to incorporate new accessible branding colors and tagline so print and web colors match
- Code refactoring is needed to remove table-based layout
- Complete A/B testing for layout to determine on a 3 or 2 column layout
- Bring photography to the branding forefront
- Work with Marketing and Sales managers to identify business needs for the new homepage 

> It may not seem like a problem to have a lot of products, but if not organized efficiently and the navigation not clear then getting sales from those products can start being ineffective. A good e-commerce website creates an easy purchasing experience.

## Team exploration and planning for a MVP release
Stay Online brought me onto the EU launch team due to my familiarity with the U.S. website and my experience with responsive development. I co-led a discovery session to explore eCommerce requirements, limitations, and internationalization 
needs.

### Why internationalization?
Stay Online needed an EU location for shipping but you might ask, *why did they need a new website?*
- easy localization for target audience culture, region, language
- coding process allows for translation easily

### Information Gathering  
- considerations such as GDPR, color best-practices, localized terms
- Marketing and Sales teams were interviewed for their specific needs - feedback was then prioritized into sprints      
- Existing sub-sites and marketing materials would be carried over incrementally as translations were completed
- Grouped notes and outlined internal goals from a maintenance and code-based standpoint
 
### Project Requirements  
- A large amount of product APIs were required with little to no rewrite as the U.S. site also used the same data     
- Focus on minimal viable product (MVP) for the first release 
- Time would be a large design and development hindrance
- Waterfall release method


## Internationalization and globalization was at the heart of market research 
- international sales interns, Outside Sales team members, and the Marketing team were interviewed      
- Marketing ran specific user surveys
- The website would need multi-language support, translated documentation, and branding tweaks
- Focus on bold colors, image-focused design, EU-specific regulation requirements
- Unicode considerations
- Coding requirements to allow easier auto translation of content 

## A new market means new users and expectations

### What do users of this new website need?  
- Two categories of user were identified: internal team member and external purchasing customer      
- Stay Online team members would submit orders on behalf of the company and for phone orders
- External customers included one time buy customers and return annual buyers who bought in bulk
- Greater expectation for product customization and proof that products meet EU regulations
- User flows, based on current requirements and frustrations, were created. These identified a common difficulty of finding products quickly

### Major navigation changes 
- Existing U.S. approach for site navigation was with a sidebar menu that grew in height over time      
- Initial A/B testing on a mega menu style horizontal navigation vs the existing vertical style
- Testers expressed confusion over navigation location (mega menu was not toggled on load so the only available navigation link was “products”)
- After several prototype versions, using tester feedback, a decision was made to revert to the sidebar approach but keep the new category labels

*A/B testing was done on having sidebar navigation vs a mega menu navigation. Testers prefered the sidebar navigation.* 

## The takeaway

- 👍 The website saw improved search efficiency over the A/B testing and launch period through the use of categories
- 👍 Optimized keywords increased efficiency in finding products via search
- 👌 Category changes were implemented without negatively affecting the U.S. database (the plan was to merge category changes over to the U.S site)
- Internationalization is not just translation and takes time and effort from many cross-functional teams  
- The site was released on a very short timeline. I learned a lot from leading this project, both about global standards but also how to properly manage multiple teams.
