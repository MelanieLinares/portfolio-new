  ### Overview:


  Insight’s Digital Innovation team helps companies implement digital solutions from discovery to delivery. During 2019 select individuals from the team came together to improve Insight's stake in accessibility. My role in this go-to-market plan involved ideation, creation of a delivery deck, documentation for bid strategy, and triage.


  **The Problem:** <span aria-hidden="true">🤔</span><br/> Accessibility as an integrated solution was lacking. Insight had several subject matter experts but outisde of internal initiatives was not making use of this knowledge for clients.


  **The Plan:** <span aria-hidden="true">💡</span><br/> Through thoughtful internal planning and education a go-to-market strategy for Insight would be launched as a way for Insight to start taking on accessibility-specific projects. This would start with team education and would end with a client bid.

            ## Discovery & ideation

            ### Heart for user & client experience

            Most of our team knew how to integrate accessibility into the design and development process, but we didn’t have a formal audit methodology.


            #### The first week consisted of research:

            * Who is the client and what are their needs? (some of this was provided by the client prior to the bid)

            * What are some common audit practices and patterns?

            * How can we stand out?


            That final question of <u>standing out</u> became the main focus. Our team had the heart and the accessible design/development experience, but we lacked audit-specific experience. Rather than keep the deliverable to only a handoff of data the team focused on integrating remediation as part of the bid. We sought to answer the “okay, now what?” that can follow introducing anyone to new concepts. We sought empathy in our bid for clients that may be overwhelmed with the changes needed for compliance.

          **The go-to market accessibility team held a few ideation sessions resulting in a
          methodology proposal to:**


          * quantify issue complexity and severity

          * identify specific teams and individuals who could offer valuable remediation experience for a variety of issues

          * bridge the info-gap between the user with disabilities and stakeholders that still struggle to see accessibility as beneficial outside of lawsuit prevention 

          * give realistic expectations of audit results, delivery, and remediation planning without first seeing the design or code for the product involved in the bid

          ### Hunger for continued improvement


          I ran a mock audit of Insight’s website. The purpose was to practice and present to project stakeholders a real plan for changes that should and could be implemented internally. 


          **The practice audit included:**

        process: true
        blurbcards:
          - textcards: establishing a scope
          - textcards: creating a t-shirt sizing approach to ranking issue severity and
              complexity
          - textcards: presenting the results to a sampling of sales team managers and
              development managers
      - type: generic_content

          We had to be ready with not just a usability answer, but be
          able to point out specific guidelines as reference to back up our
          recommendations. We needed to highlight the assistive technology along
          with user impact. We aimed to be approachable and specific in
          discussing the remediation timeline.

          <div class="caption"><em>The team reviewed the initial autit results. We discovered some initial gaps in the proposal and refined before sending the documentation to Sales.</em></div>


          Our hunger for hands-on knowledge did not stop with audit
          and delivery practice. I and another team member consulted with the sales team. We
          discussed how the team can prioritize accessibility when seeking to
          win clients and projects. The goal was to sell accessibility as a new
          pillar</u> in all our offerings rather than an optional service."

            ## The client bid

            Now that our team, Management, and Sales were unified in a strategy,
            we reviewed the bid requirements. The client needed time and cost
            estimates, as well as an action plan outlined. We were not given
            access to code samples, but did have access to the public website. The
            following was considered within the bid:


            * explanation of remediation level recommended

            * branding color considerations with plans to remediate while keeping identity intact if issues are found

            * third-party component remediation plan and recommendations for easy, accessible solutions if issues are found

            * an agile solution to remediation in phases during testing process

            * client priority and access to dedicated UX and accessibility experts for questions

            * plan for continued monitoring

            * plan for client education to prevent accessibility issues from being reintroduced

          ## The takeaway
          
          Insight didn’t win this bid but did prove to internal Insight team members and managers the need for improvements within each department. Initiatives were shortly implemented to encourage team members to get certified and engage in training. This directly led to the Accessibility track of new teammate onboarding.
