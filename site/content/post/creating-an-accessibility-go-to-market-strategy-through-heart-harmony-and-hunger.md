introheading: "I started with one main goal: bring change in how Insight markets
  accessibility"

  How a company incorporates accessibility into the product cycle says a lot
  about the impact those changes will make. When I started as a UX Developer at
  Cardinal Solutions (later Insight via a merger) increasing accessibility
  awareness was my number one goal.\

  \

  I ran multiple workshops, virtual training, and even started the baseline of the accessibility ACE (accelerated consultant experience) program prior to my departure. This caught the attention of the north east regional UX manager and he started the A11y Rocks team to focus the company’s accessibility efforts. Together we formulated a go-to market strategy to win a client for Insight’s first accessibility audit, utilizing Insight’s core pillars: heart, harmony, and hunger.

          design and development process, but we didn’t have a formal audit
          methodology. The first week consisted of the following research:"

              - Who is the client and what are their needs? (some of this was
              provided in the bid brief)


              - What are some common audit practices and patterns?


              - How can we stand out?
      - type: Content02
        Content002: That final question of standing out became the main focus. Our team
          had the heart and the design/development experience, but we lacked
          audit-specific experience. Rather than keep the deliverable to a
          handoff of data only, the team focused on integrating remediation as
          part of our bid. We sought to answer the “okay, now what?” that can
          follow introducing anyone to new concepts.

          An audit considers the compliance of a product and the data as the results, but now that you have a long list of issues what do you do?

          **The A11y team held a few ideation sessions which resulted in a system that could:**


          * quantify issue complexity and severity 

          * prioritize specific teams and individuals that could jump in and offer valuable remediation experience for a variety of issues 

          * bridge the info gap of the user with disabilities and the user for certain stakeholders that still struggle to see accessibility as beneficial outside of lawsuit prevention 

          * give realistic expectations of audit, results delivery, and remediation planning without first seeing a single visual for the product involved in the bid

      ## Hunger for continued improvement


      **We ran a practice audit of Insight’s website. This included:**


      * establishing a scope

      * a t-shirt sizing approach to ranking issue severity and complexity

      * presented the results to a sampling of sales team managers and development managers


      The purpose was practice, but also to present a real plan for real changes that should and could be implemented internally. 


      Thankfully there were many questions and concerns similar to that of what a client may have. We had to be ready with not just a usability answer, but be able to point out specific guidelines as reference. We needed to highlight the assistive technology along with user impact, and be approachable and specific in discussing the remediation timeline.


      Our hunger for hands-on knowledge did not stop with audit and delivery practice. Our team consulted with the sales team and together discussed how they can prioritize accessibility in their efforts to win clients and projects. The goal was to sell accessibility as a new pillar in all our offerings rather than an optional service.
