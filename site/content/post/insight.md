## I started with one main goal: bring change in how Insight markets accessibility
Insight Digital Innovation is a sector of Insight with a focus on product design. Accessibility, however, was not part of their core process when I was brought on-board. As part of Insight‚Äôs global team, I utilized the company‚Äôs values to evangelize accessibility as a standard, not an optional offering. These values are Heart, Hunger, and Harmony.

## Heart for the team
I was part of the accessibility go-to-market planning committee. This team was hand-picked by the UX department lead. The team worked on a Sales presentation and plan for integrating accessibility into other products and services. Teammates have reached out to me for my knowledge of accessibility, CSS, and UX. I was invited to be an **inclusive and diversity event lead** as well as part of the **"A11y Rocks" accessibility design team**.

## Hunger for professional betterment

 I am a certified Web Accessibility Specialist from IAAP as of 2021 [I'm in their directory](post/brewing-chemex/#comparing-the-results)
 - ![this is the alt text](/img/vue-react.png "Title is optional")
 Through Insight I was able to learn 
Vue and React at an expediated pace. 
(And I love Vue!) üî•

## Harmony through mentorship
Insight allowed several opportunities for teammates to share professional knowledge. I have mentored junior developers 1-on-1, hosted several ‚ÄúLunch N' Learns‚Äù (which are short, single topic talks during lunch breaks). I planned a class for employees on accessibility for Insight‚Äôs Accelerated Consultant Education program.

## The takeaway:  
I loved working with Insight and especially my close team. 
I came to Insight with the goal to expand the state of accessibility within the company. I am proud that I 
helped spark what I hope is long lasting innovation and cultural change. ü§ü
