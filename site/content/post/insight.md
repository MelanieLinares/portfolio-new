## I started with one main goal: bring change in how Insight markets accessibility
Insight Digital Innovation is a sector of Insight with a focus on innovation for product design.
Services they provide include but are not limited to digital strategy, intelligent 
applications, and DevOps. As part of Insight's global team I utilized the company's values 
in order to evangelize accessibility as a standard, not an optional offering. These values
are Hunger, Heart, and Harmony.

## Hunger for professional betterment

 I am a certified Web Accessibility Specialist from IAAP as of 2021 [I'm in their directory](post/brewing-chemex/#comparing-the-results)

 Through Insight I was able to learn 
Vue and React at an expediated pace. 
(And I love Vue!) ðŸ”¥

## Heart for the team
During my time with the team I was part of the **accessibility go-to-market planning committee**. 
With the UX department head, the small hand-picked team worked on a Sales presentation and 
plan for accessibility to integrate into other DI (Digital Innovation) products & services. 
On several occasions teammates reached out to me for my unique perspectives on accessibility, 
CSS, and user experience. These perspectives were happily noticed when I was invited to be an 
**inclusive and diversity event lead** as well as part of the **"A11y Rocks" accessibility design team**.

## Harmony through mentorship
Insight allowed several opportunities for teammates to share professional knowledge. I have 
mentored junior developers 1-on-1, hosted several "Lunch N' Learns" (which are short single 
topic talks during company lunch breaks), and planned a class to give new hires a jumpstart 
on accessibility through Insight's ACE (Accelerated Consultant Education) program.

## The takeaway:  
I loved working with Insight and especially my close team. 
I came to Insight with the goal to expand the state of accessibility and I am proud that I 
helped spark what I hope is long lasting innovation and cultural change. ðŸ¤Ÿ
