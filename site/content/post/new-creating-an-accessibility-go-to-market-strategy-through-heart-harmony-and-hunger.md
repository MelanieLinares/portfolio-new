  ### Overview:


  Insight’s Digital Innovation team works closely with designers, developers, and technology experts to help companies implement next-generation digital solutions from the discovery to delivery phase. During 2019 the collective of individuals with the knowledge to take on accessibility solutions came together to take accessibility within the company from a nice to have, to a best in class integrated solution.


  My role in this go-to-market plan involved planning and creating a delivery deck, documentation for bid strategy and triage priority, as well as being an accessibility advocate to department leads.


  **Problem:** <br/> Accessibility as an integrated solution was lacking, resulting in the delivery of some inaccessible products.


  **Plan:** <br/> Through thoughtful internal planning and education a small team was formed of like-minded and skilled individuals to launch a go-to-market strategy for Insight as an up incomer in the field. This would start with team education and would end with a client bid.

            ### Heart for user (and client) experience

            Most of our team knew how to integrate accessibility into the design and development process, but we didn’t have a formal audit methodology.


            **The first week consisted of research:**

            * Who is the client and what are their needs? (some of this was provided in the bid brief)

            * What are some common audit practices and patterns?

            * How can we stand out?


            That final question of standing out became the main focus. Our team had the heart and the design/development experience, but we lacked audit-specific experience. Rather than keep the deliverable to a handoff of data only, the team focused on integrating remediation as part of our bid. We sought to answer the “okay, now what?” that can follow introducing anyone to new concepts. We sought empathy in our bid for clients that may be overwhelmed with the changes needed for compliance.

            **The A11y team held a few ideation sessions which resulted in a
            methodology that could:**


            * quantify issue complexity and severity

            * identify specific teams and individuals who could offer valuable remediation experience for a variety of issues

            * bridge the info-gap between the user with disabilities and stakeholders that still struggle to see accessibility as beneficial outside of lawsuit prevention 

            * give realistic expectations of audit results, delivery, and remediation planning without first seeing a single visual for the product involved in the bid

          ### Hunger for continued improvement


          We ran a mock audit of Insight’s website. The purpose was to practice and present to project stakeholders a real plan for changes that should and could be implemented internally. 


          **The practice audit included:**

        process: true
        blurbcards:
          - textcards: establishing a scope
          - textcards: creating a t-shirt sizing approach to ranking issue severity and
              complexity
          - textcards: presenting the results to a sampling of sales team managers and
              development managers
      - type: generic_content
        generic_content: "We had to be ready with not just a usability answer, but be
          able to point out specific guidelines as reference to back up our
          recommendations. We needed to highlight the assistive technology along
          with user impact. We aimed to be approachable and specific in
          discussing the remediation timeline.

          Our hunger for hands-on knowledge did not stop with audit
          and delivery practice. Our team consulted with the sales team. We
          discussed how the team can prioritize accessibility when seeking to
          win clients and projects. The goal was to sell accessibility as a new
          pillar in all our offerings rather than an optional service."

            N﻿ow that our team, Management, and Sales were unified in a strategy
            we reviewed the bid requirements. The client needed time and cost
            estimates, as well as an action plan outlined. We were not given
            access to code samples, but did have access to the public website.
            The following was considered within the bid:


            * explanation of remediation level recommended

            * branding color considerations with plans to remediate while keeping identity intact if issues are found

            * third-party component remediation plan and recommendations for easy, accessible solutions if issues are found

            * cost as an agile solution to begin remediation in phases during testing process

            * client priority and access to dedicated UX and accessibility experts for questions

            * plan for continued monitoring

            * plan for client education to prevent accessibility issues from being reintroduced
