introheading: "I started with one main goal: bring change in how Insight markets
  accessibility"
introbody: >-
  How a company incorporates accessibility into the product cycle says a lot
  about the impact those changes will make. When I started as a UX Developer at
  Cardinal Solutions (later Insight via a merger), increasing accessibility
  awareness was my number one goal.


  I ran many workshops and virtual training for team members on accessibility tools and methodology. This caught the attention of the northeast regional UX manager. He started the A11y Rocks team with handpicked individuals, including myself, to focus the company’s accessibility efforts.


  Insight knew the importance of accessibility. Over several years they had formed a strong collective of individuals with the knowledge to take on accessibility solutions. The problem was Insight had not focused its efforts on accessibility projects. Accessible practices were completed at the discretion of the individual. Clients were not being educated and teammates were not being held accountable for designing and developing according to WCAG guidelines. The go-to-market plan would allow Insight to gain the experience and knowledge needed to enter the competitive accessibility market.

            ## Discovery and ideation


            ### Heart for user (and client) experience


            Most of our team knew how to integrate accessibility into the design and development process, but we didn’t have a formal audit methodology.


            **The first week consisted of research:** 


            * Who is the client and what are their needs? (some of this was provided in the bid brief) 

            * What are some common audit practices and patterns?

            * How can we stand out?


            That final question of standing out became the main focus. Our team had the heart and the design/development experience, but we lacked audit-specific experience. Rather than keep the deliverable to a handoff of data only, the team focused on integrating remediation as part of our bid. We sought to answer the “okay, now what?” that can follow introducing anyone to new concepts.

            **The A11y team held a few ideation sessions which resulted in a
            system that could:**


            * quantify issue complexity and severity

            * identify specific teams and individuals who could offer valuable remediation experience for a variety of issues

            * bridge the info-gap between the user with disabilities and stakeholders that still struggle to see accessibility as beneficial outside of lawsuit prevention 

            * give realistic expectations of audit results, delivery, and remediation planning without first seeing a single visual for the product involved in the bid

          ## Validating the requirements


          ### Hunger for continued improvement


          We ran a practice audit of Insight’s website. The purpose was to practice and present a real plan for changes that should and could be implemented internally.


          The practice audit included:
      - type: cards
        iconcards:
          - textcards: establishing a scope
          - textcards: creating a t-shirt sizing approach to ranking issue severity and
              complexity
          - textcards: presenting the results to a sampling of sales team managers and
              development managers
      - type: generic_content
        generic-content: "We had to be ready with not just a usability answer, but be
          able to point out specific guidelines as reference to back up our
          recommendations. We needed to highlight the assistive technology along
          with user impact. We aimed to be approachable and specific in
          discussing the remediation timeline.


          \r

          \r

          Our hunger for hands-on knowledge did not stop with audit
          and delivery practice. Our team consulted with the sales team. We
          discussed how the team can prioritize accessibility when seeking to
          win clients and projects. The goal was to sell accessibility as a new
          pillar in all our offerings rather than an optional service."
