## Transforming a complex process into a powerful digital workflow impacting thousands
Imagine a stack of physical applications encompasing a year's worth of unentered data for several hundred NC citizens, all waiting to be approved for a small device thast would allow them to drive and continue life normally after a DUI. Now imagine that paperwork backlog is six years worth of pending applications. 

**the challenge:** the current NCDMV system was not built for the number of participants and time needed to not only add new receipients to the databasee, but also edit, manage status, curate documentation, and maintain those already on the legacy systemâ€”in addition to vendors of the device itself. The backlog was a problem.

A new internal portal would need to be created so that NCDMV employees could access and process participant and vendor data for hundreds of thousands of citizens, efficiently and securely.

**The goal:** accessibility within a 3rd-party (SharePoint 2016) can be tricky, but 
we needed to reach > 90  

**Project team:**  front-end developer (myself), manager

## Project overview and task breakdown 

- BBLLLAAAHHHH Design needs to maintain IE6+ (and later IE8+) browser compatibility
- Data-heavy pages need to balance showing necessary data and providing an ideal mobile experience
- Use-cases for redesign include customers, but also warehouse workers and sales employees at tradeshows
- Branding needs to incorporate new accessible branding colors and tagline so print and web colors match
- Code refactoring is needed to remove table-based layout
- Complete A/B testing for layout to determine on a 3 or 2 column layout
- Bring photography to the branding forefront
- Work with Marketing and Sales managers to identify business needs for the new homepage 

> It may not seem like a problem to have a lot of products, but if they are not organized efficiently and the navigation not clear then all those products can start being too many. A good e-commerce website creates an easy purchasing experience.

## Development considerations & challenges

## The takeaway:  
Y'all, did you know that React is great for making dynamic components? ðŸ˜‰ Because this project was component-driven! 
I learned a lot about component hierarchy through this project and it was a deep dive on learning TypeScript. Starbucks 
has a very knowledgeable team that was a great asset when I needed help. I always love working directly with UX and 
back-end teammates and this project experience had both. The Starbucks team knew what they needed from this platform 
and I'm glad our team was able to deliver. â˜•âœ¨
