## Changing a simple form into a powerful workflow
Managing assets can be a pain if the application does not allow for dynamic actions with fewer clicks.
I worked with UX to implement and improve wireframes, create case studies and identify edge cases. 
My role was to take the approved design and specs and build out the needed pages and components.

**Specific tasks:**
- create new UI components
- ensure reusability of existing and new components
- integrate with REST apis
- identify and debug code and UI errors
- improve error descriptions and UI notifications       

## The takeaway:  
Y'all, did you know that React is great for making dynamic components? ðŸ˜‰ Because this project was component-driven! 
I learned a lot about component hierarchy through this project and it was a deep dive on learning TypeScript. Starbucks 
has a very knowledgeable team that was a great asset when I needed help. I always love working directly with UX and 
back-end teammates and this project experience had both. The Starbucks team knew what they needed from this platform 
and I'm glad our team was able to deliver. â˜•âœ¨
