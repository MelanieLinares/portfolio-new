preview_problem: Government websites, including those of local agencies, need to be accessible. The NCDOT websites were not meeting minimum compliance. 
preview_intro: The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) had a website redesign in 2018. This design established a new set of SharePoint templates and a new design system, but lacked meeting accessibility compliance. I worked with the UX and Web Services team to conduct an audit and establish a remediation plan that would work with and be easily adaptable to the existing design system and components.
