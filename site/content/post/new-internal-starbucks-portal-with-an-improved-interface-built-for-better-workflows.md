  ### Overview:


  Managing data can be a pain if common actions within an application result in errors or the actions are not easily found within the UI. My role involved developing components with React and TypeScript.




  **Problem:**\

  The internal Starbucks portal experienced sync issues and error management issues in regards to portfolio percentages.




  **Solution:**\

  The Starbucks management team needed to easily see percentages of funding and re-adjust portfolios, calculations, and cross-portfolio assets within portfolios. A main dashboard with access to all portfolios and the ability to display cross-portfolio information would be best for user experience.

            ## Meeting with the team to workshop improvements


            At this point in 2021 Starbucks was still adjusting to virtual work. To make sure everyone was comfortable with the project a kick-off meeting was held. The meeting agenda involved going over the development environment and establishing expectations.


            > The first step in exceeding customer expectations is to know those expectations


            ### Expectations


            * I would need to deliver on a fast turn-around schedule

            * Weekly stand-up meetings would be required along with code reviews

            * React and Typescript were utilized in developing widgets, including the creation and application of variables for branding color and typography 

            * I would be working with the product and engineering teams on enterprise-facing features

          ## Working with the UX team to refine UI


          The UX team first met with shareholders to create the initial version of the UI. I met with the UX team and we worked together to harmonize the feedback, along with information I gathered from the data team. There were several problems to be solved, not merely a UI to create.


          ### How might we avoid errors when users change how revenue is divided and utilized?


          Existing APIs for each portfolio were causing issues due to calculations occurring after form submission and only within a current portfolio set. If revenue allotments for portfolios A, B, and C were below 100%, users could make changes. The UI was not properly informing users when a portfolio or a sub-portfolio would cause the main portfolio to exceed 100%. The big question was how should errors be handled within the UI and within the API? Could and should errors be avoided?

              ### Refining the UI to account for errors


              * I collaborated with product and design teams to define features and identify opportunities for improvement

              * The prototype was improved to account for edge cases in user flow

              * Error messages and notifications were improved by providing thoughtful feedback

              * Eï»¿rror messages and portal data visualizations needed to ne accessible

            ## Building the components according to atomic design


            * I developed UI components based on existing widgets and from scratch utilizing React, Typescript, and some Java

            * Collaboration was important to the process. I worked with the backend and frontend teams to ensure optimized API calls between parent and child components

            * Some components included: typography, color palettes, data cards, tables, modals, and forms

            * Testing API and working with API developers
              Building dashboard based on interactive prototype from UX designer (our team)
            * Adding portfolios to sidebar menu, including sub portfolios added dynamically by user
