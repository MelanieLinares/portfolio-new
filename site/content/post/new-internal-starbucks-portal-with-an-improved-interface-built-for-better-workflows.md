introheading: Updating the dashboard UI to lead to a better management workflow
introbody: >-
  Managing data can be a pain if the application does not give easy access to
  common actions. My role involved building out pages and components with React
  and TypeScript.


  The business learned clients needed to easily see percentages of funding and re-adjust portfolios, calculations, and cross-portfolio assets within portfolios. Concerns were raised to achieve the goal with fewer clicks. A main dashboard would allow direct adjustments as well as portfolio-specific views.

            ## Meeting with the team to workshop improvements


            At this point in 2021 Starbucks was still adjusting to virtual work. To make sure everyone was comfortable with the project a kick-off meeting was held. The meeting agenda involved going over the development environment and establishing expectations.


            > The first step in exceeding customer expectations is to know those expectations




            **Expectations:**


            * I would need to deliver on a fast turn-around schedule

            * Weekly stand-up meetings would be required along with code reviews

            * React and Typescript was the Javascript library and language I would be working with
              I would need to utilize branding colors and established widgets 
            * I would be working with the product and engineering teams on enterprise-facing features

            stand-up meetings.

            When multiple teams work together, several perspectives
            and expertise can be utilized. The UX team first met with
            shareholders to create the initial version of the UI. I met with the
            UX team and we worked together to harmonize the feedback, along with
            information I gathered from the data team. There were several
            problems to be solved, not merely a UI to create.


            ### How might we avoid errors when users change how
            revenue is divided and utilized?


            Existing APIs for each portfolio were causing issues for
            users making changes due to calculations occurring after form
            submission and only within a current portfolio set. If revenue
            allotments for portfolios A, B, and C were below 100%, users could
            make changes. The UI was not properly informing users when a
            portfolio or a sub-portfolio would cause the main portfolio to
            exceed 100%. The big question was how should errors be handled
            within the UI and within the API? Could and should errors be
            avoided?"

                ### Refining the UI to account for errors


                * I collaborated with product and design teams to define features and identify opportunities for improvement

                * The prototype was improved to account for edge cases in user flow

                * Error messages and notifications were improved by providing thoughtful feedback

            ## Building the components according to atomic design


            * I developed UI components based on existing widgets and from scratch utilizing React, Typescript, and some Java

            * Collaboration was important to the process. I worked with the backend and frontend teams to ensure optimized API calls between parent and child components

            * Some components included: typography, color palettes, data cards, tables, modals, and forms

            * Testing API and working with API developers
              Building dashboard based on interactive prototype from UX designer (our team)
            * Adding portfolios to sidebar menu, including sub portfolios added dynamically by user
